# IcarusIDE

In this document is exposed the research made in base of the premise: “How to enhance a soft 
core?” Since the beggining of the generation of this documentation, analizing the structures 
that have been used from last decade, spins and new issues found in new proposals, until the 
generation of a hardware generator, moving the paradigm of “The programmer should adapt 
to the hardware he is using” to “The hardware should adapt to the software that is being 
programmed” this using a proposed architecture that use a single instruction as processing 
core. 
Abstracts of other proposals will be exposed in the way they were used in the process to adapt 
the microcontroller Ícarus, with the key elements, and some experiences of the auther in the 
different áreas of the electronic design and programming. 
Theoretic developments and execution tests, make clear the effectiveness of the presented 
work in this thesis, with execution of problems in real time, and simulation to compare the 
proposed tool with commercial tools.
